**What is this Project/NLP Technique?:**

This project is a password strength checker that analyzes passwords to ensure they are secure. It checks for length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and common weak patterns. The NLP technique used is pattern recognition, where the program detects common sequences like "123", "abc", or "qwerty" that make passwords easier to guess. In the code, a list of weak sequences is stored in Sequences.txt, and the method checkCommonSequences(password) scans the password for these patterns. If a match is found, the program warns the user to choose a stronger password.
